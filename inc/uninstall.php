 * Composer Uninstall.
 *
 * This will loop through installed packages and delete the folders
 * of those packages. When not using a simple /vendor folder for this,
 * this makes it easy to to a simple re-install of all packages.
 *
 * I would chmod +x this file, then create an alias that will execute this
 * script.
 *
 * See example at: https://github.com/aubreypwd/Bash/search?q=composer+uninstall&unscoped_q=composer+uninstall
